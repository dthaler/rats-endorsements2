Having trouble with cloning and building, so no PR yet, but wanted to share before the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RATS verifier receives evidence from an attester that must be considered untrusted until established otherwise. This trust is established using cryptography. Typically, the attester will sign a nonce with a private key it possesses and the verifier will verify it with a public key it possesses. While this is typical, cryptography other than public key may also be used.\r\n\r\nSince it is not possible to establish trust in an attester without cryptography, the verifier must have a verification key for each attester.  The verification key comes to the verifier in an endorsement from an endorser.\r\n\r\nNo particularly algorithm or cryptographic protocol is assumed for the verification of the attester. The verification key could be a symmetric key, a public key or something more sophisticated. Thus there is no assumption about the type of verification key in the endorsement.\r\n\r\n(In theory the verification key could also come in reference values or appraisal policy, the other inputs to the verifier, but that would not line up with the descriptions in the RATS architecture).\r\n",
